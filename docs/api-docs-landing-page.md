# Mockttp [![Build Status](https://github.com/httptoolkit/mockttp/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/httptoolkit/mockttp/actions) [![Available on NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/mockttp.svg)](https://npmjs.com/package/mockttp)

These are the API reference docs for Mockttp. If you're not sure what Mockttp is, it's best to start from the [README](https://github.com/httptoolkit/mockttp/#readme) instead.

On the other hand, if you're looking for detailed documentation, you're in the right place!

From here you can explore all the exported types and statically exported functions from the sidebar on the right, you can use the search button (top right) to jump to specific documentation by name, or you're not sure you probably want to start at the [Mockttp type](./interfaces/Mockttp.html) and follow the types from there.

Can't find what you're looking for, missing important info, or generally confused? Please [file an issue](https://github.com/httptoolkit/mockttp/issues/new) and help Mockttp's docs get better.
