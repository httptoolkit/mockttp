/**
 * This file exports the core pluggable admin types, without anything Mockttp-specific
 * included. That's useful so that downstream usage of pluggable without Mockttp doesn't
 * need to load all our dependencies (especially heavy things like brotli-wasm).
 *
 * In future these parts might be extracted into a separate library, but it's a bit tricky
 * to do so immediately as the server side does actually include some unavoidable Mockttp
 * dependencies for API backward compatibility.
 *
 * Everything exported here is experimental, and many change unpredictably in future releases.
