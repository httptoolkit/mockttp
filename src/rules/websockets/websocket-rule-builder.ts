 * A builder for defining websocket mock rules. Create one using
 * `.forAnyWebSocket(path)` on a Mockttp instance, then call whatever
 * methods you'd like here to define more precise matching behaviour,
 * control how the connection is handled, and how many times this
 * rule should be applied.
 *
 * When you're done, call a `.thenX()` method to register the configured rule
 * with the server. These return a promise for a MockedEndpoint, which can be
 * used to verify the details of the requests matched by the rule.
 *
 * This returns a promise because rule registration can be asynchronous,
 * either when using a remote server or testing in the browser. Wait for the
 * promise returned by `.thenX()` methods to guarantee that the rule has taken
 * effect before sending requests to it.
